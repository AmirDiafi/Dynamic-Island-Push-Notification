## Handle Push Notification with Dynamic Island 🚨

## Descreption:
Since there is not library for Apple Push Notifications with the new feature of
 iPhone 14 Pro/Max,

I made a full custom Dynamic Island Notifications listener for the APNs.

Notes:
</summary>

Since the Dynamic Island is not supported only on two devices (iPhone 14 Pro & iPhone 14 Pro Max),
that makes easy for us to detect what if this device support Dynamc Island or not.

Minimum iOS support is 13.
